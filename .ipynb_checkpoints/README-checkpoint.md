# Exploration of Diamonds Data
## By: Morris Muchiri
### Data description:
This data set contains the different attributes which are associated with diamonds which include **price**, **depth**, **type of color**, **type of cut** and **type of color**
Some of the questions which I was investigating is:
* How are the various attributes distributed
* What are the relationships between the different variables
### Summary of the findings
* I visualized that there was a +ve correlation between the **type of carat** and the **price** which means that the higher the **carat type** the higher the **price**
* I visualized the **premium cut** had the highest mean price while the **ideal cut** had the lowest.
* Diamond **clarity (S12)** is the most expensive
